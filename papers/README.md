# Papers

This folder contains a selection of key papers—both **historically important** and **introductory**—on **gauge theory**, with the goal of providing context and background necessary to engage critically with **Eric Weinstein's 2021 draft on Geometric Unity**.

## Purpose

Understanding Weinstein's proposal requires familiarity with the mathematical and physical foundations of gauge theory, including concepts like fiber bundles, connections, symmetry groups, and field equations. These papers trace the development of those ideas from early 20th-century geometry through to their central role in modern theoretical physics.

## Organization

The PDFs in this folder are roughly grouped into:

- **Historical Foundations**: Original works by Weyl, Yang-Mills, and others.
- **Mathematical Frameworks**: Papers introducing differential geometry, fiber bundles, and gauge connections.
- **Physical Applications**: Articles applying gauge theory to the Standard Model, QED/QCD, and electroweak unification.
- **Topological and Geometric Perspectives**: Resources that bridge physics and modern geometry.

## Recommended Starting Points

If you're new to the subject or need a refresher, consider beginning with:

1. **Weyl (1918)** – Gauge invariance and the geometry of scale.
2. **Yang & Mills (1954)** – Non-abelian gauge theory formulation.
3. **Survey texts on fiber bundles and connections** – E.g., papers or chapters by Kobayashi & Nomizu or Baez & Muniain.
4. **Geometric treatments of field theory** – Papers that explicitly connect gauge theory to gravity and unification proposals.

## Notes

Some papers include brief annotations or summaries to guide your reading. More files may be added as the collection expands.

If you have suggestions for additional key papers or want to contribute annotations, feel free to open a pull request or issue.

*This collection is maintained as part of a broader effort to explore and evaluate alternative proposals in theoretical physics, particularly those that emphasize geometric unification.*
