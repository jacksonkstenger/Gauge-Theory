# Gauge Theory

This folder contains a curated selection of **introductory** and **historically significant** papers on **gauge theory**, intended to help establish the necessary background to critically engage with **Eric Weinstein’s 2021 draft on Geometric Unity**.

## Purpose

Eric Weinstein’s *Geometric Unity* proposal touches on advanced concepts in differential geometry, gauge theory, and unification. To approach it seriously, one must first understand the foundational ideas that shaped the development of modern gauge theories—both in mathematics and in physics. This collection provides a pathway through key texts that illuminate the evolution of the field and the conceptual tools that Weinstein draws upon.

## What's Inside

- **Historical Foundations**: Works by Weyl, Yang & Mills, and others who first formulated gauge invariance.
- **Mathematical Background**: Essential papers and surveys on fiber bundles, connections, and curvature.
- **Applications in Physics**: Seminal papers on the Standard Model, symmetry breaking, and field theory.
- **Topological and Geometric Insights**: Resources on Chern classes, anomalies, and gauge-theoretic approaches to gravity.

## Topics Covered

- U(1), SU(2), SU(3) gauge symmetry groups  
- Connections and curvature in principal bundles  
- Yang-Mills equations and their physical interpretation  
- Gauge invariance and symmetry breaking  
- The geometry of field theories  
- Chern-Simons theory and anomalies  
- Attempts to geometrize physics

## Suggested Reading Path

To build a solid foundation before approaching *Geometric Unity*:

1. **Weyl (1918)** – Original idea of gauge invariance  
2. **Yang & Mills (1954)** – Non-Abelian gauge theory  
3. **Fiber Bundles and Connections** – Mathematical underpinnings  
4. **Gauge Theories and the Standard Model** – Modern applications  
5. **Topological Tools** – Chern classes, anomalies, and index theorems  

## Notes

- Files are organized by theme and author.
- Some subfolders contain brief notes or reading guides.
- Contributions and suggestions for further readings are welcome.

This collection is meant as both a **study aid** and a **historical reference**, with the goal of grounding any critical exploration of modern unification proposals in the rigorous literature that preceded them.
